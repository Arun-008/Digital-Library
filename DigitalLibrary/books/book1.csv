Introduction to Java Programming
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA).
This means that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

In this book, you will learn the fundamentals of Java programming including variables, data types, control flow, classes, and object-oriented principles.
