Basics of Data Structures
Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently.
Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

Arrays are collections of elements identified by index or key, stored in contiguous memory locations.
Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

Stacks follow Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and are used for tasks such as expression evaluation and backtracking.
Queues follow First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and are used in scenarios like order processing and scheduling.

Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes, commonly used in database indexing and file systems.
Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges and are useful for representing networks such as social connections or routing paths.

Understanding data structures is fundamental to designing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems effectively.
